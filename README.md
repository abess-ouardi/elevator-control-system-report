# Elevator Control System (CODESYS, IEC 61131-3)

This project develops a **complete elevator control system** using **CODESYS** and the **IEC 61131-3** automation standard.  
It integrates Sequential Function Chart (SFC) and Structured Text (ST) programming to handle initialization, service policy, emergency management, and HMI interaction.

## ðŸ“˜ Contents
- Modular design using Generalized Actuators (GA)
- Call management and scheduling policy
- Emergency button handling and fault simulation
- Humanâ€“Machine Interface (HMI) visualization
- System simulation and validation
